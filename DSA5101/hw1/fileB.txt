Detecting fake news on social media presents unique challenges. First, fake news pieces are intentionally written to mislead consumers, which makes it not satisfactory to spot fake news from news content itself. Thus, we need to explore information in addition to news content, such as user engagements and social behaviors of users on social media. For example, a credible user’s comment that “This is fake news” is a strong signal that the news may be fake. Second, the research community lacks datasets which contain spatiotemporal information to understand how fake news propagates over time in different regions, how users react to fake news, and how we can extract useful temporal patterns for (early) fake news detection and intervention. Thus, it is necessary to have comprehensive datasets that have news content, social context and spatiotemporal information to facilitate fake news research. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing datasets only cover one or two aspects.
